ONEMOON is the first deflationary token on the Harmony ONE Network. Made by the developers of MochiSwap, ONEMOON is the first HRC20 token of its kind on the Harmony Network which is faster, cheaper, and easier to use than Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or Ethereum. Released on 04/7 9/2027, ONEMOON has already shown it has tremendous growth potential. ONEMOON is your chance to buy the first deflationary token on a leading top 100 Blockchain project. While similar BSC and ETH tokens compete for shelfspace, ONEMOON is in a shop of its own; there are no other products like it.

## What is ONEMOON?

ONEMOON is the first deflationary token on the Harmony ONE Network, built by the developers of MochiSwap. The token features a transaction fee which adds to locked liquidity, distributes tokens to ONEMOON holders, and bums both ONEMOON as well as hMOCHI (the native token of the MochiSwap DEX, on Harmony Network).

## What makes ONEMOON different?

ONEMOON is not only the first deflationary token on the Harmony Network, but it is also a deflationary mechanism for the native MochiSwap DEX token. As ONEMOON adoption increases, the hMOCHI supply tightens. ONEMOON has a first-mover advantage, helping bring new users and crypto enthusiasts to the Harmony Network while highlighting the speed, efficiency and cost-effective features of Harmony.

## WHO IS THE ONEMOON TEAM?

The developers of ONEMOON have a proven track record of success with previous blockchain ventures, most notably their cross-chain MochiSwap DEX with both BSC and Harmony support and also with running an elected node on the Harmony Network.

## WHAT DOES THE ROADMAP LOOK LIKE?

While ONEMOON is directly tied to the MochiSwap DEX, we can expect to see new MochiSwap functional features integrated which include Single-Asset Staking, AP/ and analytics dashboards, as well as fun features such as NFTs. The success of ONEMOON is parallel with the success of MochiSwap, as adoption of one will drive the adoption of the other.

## WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE FOR ONEMOON?

In the first week, we have seen a number of improvements from community efforts to help boost the overall experience of ONEMOON holders. These improvements include a customized price chart, specifically for ONEMOON (which can be seen at onemoon.watch), as well as a number of guides and tutorial assets which help streamline the process for users who are new to Harmony and DeFi. In the future,. we can expect to see a number of technical improvements on the MochiSwap DEX that will aim to automate the process and make it airtight, so that those with absolutely no experience in DeFi can have a simple time buying or selling 0NEM00N on MochiSwap.

## WHAT IS HARMONY ONE?

MochiSwap is the first cross-chain DEX on the Harmony ONE network, using the native token MOCHI which serves as both a governance and medium of exchange. MochiSwap's developers are active in the Harmony ONE community and operate one of the Elected Nodes on the Harmony Network.

## HOW CAN I VERIFY THAT LIQUIDITY IS LOCKED?

ONEMOON The developers of MochiSwap recently implemented a 3-party multisig wallet (using Gnosis Safe) to control the MochiSwap community treasure. This is a step which has been taken in order to help decentralize the MochiSwap ecosystem, and one that will help MochiSwap function properly as a DAO .. "There was never any migrator code in the DEX and the LPs cannot be tampered with by anyone. This will be provable using explorer-based contract verification in the near future."

## WHAT IS A DEFLATIONARY TOKEN?

ONEMOON is deflationary, meaning the max supply was minted at launch. As ONEMOON transactions occur, a 10% transaction fee instantly distributes tokens to all ONEMOON holders, while adding tokens to the locked liquidity, and also burning a portion of ONEMOON tokens. These features collectively drive down the circulating token supply, making ONEMOON deflationary in nature. In short, the more that ONEMOON is used, the more scare it will become.

## HOW DOES THE TOKEN FUNCTION?

ONEMOON is an HRC20 token built on the Harmony Network. At the time of writing, ONEMOON holders can store their ONEMOON tokens in Metamask, as well as buy and sell ONEMOON using the MochiSwap DEX on the Harmony Network. When ONEMOON holders buy, sell, send, or receive ONEMOON tokens a 10% transaction fee will be subtracted from the transaction total. For example: when User-A sends 1,000,000 ONEMOON tokens to User-B, a 10% fee will be provided by User-/\s transaction and used to power the ONEMOON tokenomics (for more on Tokenomics see: 'What are ONEMOON's Tokenomics?'). After the transaction fee, User B will then receive 900,000 ONEMOON tokens This transaction fee will be applied any time ONEMOON holders buy, sell, or send their ONEMOON tokens.
