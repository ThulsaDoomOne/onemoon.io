# ONEMOON Ukraine Donation

Dear Onemooners,

Undoubtedly, you would be aware of the unfortunate events unfolding in Ukraine. What's even worse is that some of our Onemoon community members who reside in that region have witnessed the invasion.

People who were living their everyday lives were abruptly thrown into chaos and conflict on the next. Families were separated against their will, and were forced to sacrifice and abandon their possessions, so that they have a chance of living another day.

Hearts were broken and lives were senselessly lost.

Everyone who is involved with crypto understands that the only way you can donate money and assure it stays in the hands of the right people is through blockchains.

The Onemoon dao group discussed this and with the blessing of the community, we have decided to donate 2500 $ONE from our treasury to a charity fund called Ukraine\_Unchained.

Unchain\_Ukraine is a charity project created by blockchain activists and is endorsed by the Harmony core team. Their big goal is to help Ukraine become the country it deserves to be: peaceful, successful, substantive, friendly, educated, and free.

Letâ€™s join them and help unchain the real power of blockchain for the good of Ukraine.

We sincerely wish everyone in Ukraine peace and prosperity,

&#x20;\- The ONEMOON Team
