### Introduction

ONEMOON is the first deflationary, passive yield generation token on the Harmony ONE network. At inception, the core premise of ONEMOON was create a frictionless static yield generation asset that offers stakeholders a new type of passive rewards which does not require the asset to be staked, or used to provide liquidity. To partake in DeFi yields all you have to do is hold ONEMOON.

There is an abundance of new users entering blockchain and DeFi. The popular yield generation methods, such as farming, providing liquidity or various other staking methods, are complex topics and can feel cumbersome to new users. This friction can slow down mass adoption of decentralized financial systems, which are meant to empower all types of users, all around the world, not just the most technically proficient in leading economies. There is nothing more convenient or simple than passively holding a DeFi asset and receiving rewards that just "appear" in your wallet.

ONEMOON is an experimental DeFi asset which uses an novel mix of deflation and passive rewards in an attempt to ease this adoption curve. Alongside with this primary goal, ONEMOON incorporates many other battle-tested traits of popular defi assets, not the least of which is the programmatic creation of Locked Liquidity. This, along with an aggressive and consistent supply burn, creates the effect of a "rising price floor" as the volume of ONE/ONEMOON locked liquidity increases.



By simply holding ONEMOON, users are able to gain exposure to the high growth DeFi sector without all the bottlenecks that are typically encountered with various other permissionless DeFi offerings.

### Tokenomics

ONEMOON incorporates the following fee and burn schedule:

* \- 5% of TX fees go to existing holders of ONEMOON as rewards.
* \- 2.5% of TX fees are used to create permanently locked liquidity between ONEMOON-ONE
* \- 1.25% is used to burn ONEMOON.
* \- 1.25% is used to burn hMOCHI.

ONEMOON employs a mechanism called "reflection" that distributes rewards to stakeholders in realtime, and with zero fees. This is achieved by effectively "rebasing" on every transaction and computing balances in realtime while viewing or entering into state-changing functions. This unique funtionality allows ONEMOON to have frictionless utitlity and generate passive yields for its stakeholders.
