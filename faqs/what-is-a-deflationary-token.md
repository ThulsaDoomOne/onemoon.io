# What is a deflationary token?

ONEMOON is deflationary, meaning the max supply was minted at launch. As ONEMOON transactions occur, a 10% transaction fee instantly distributes tokens to all ONEMOON holders, while adding tokens to the locked liquidity, and also burning a portion of ONEMOON tokens. These features collectively drive down the circulating token supply, making ONEMOON deflationary in nature. In short, the more that ONEMOON is used, the more scare it will become.
