# How does the token function?

ONEMOON is an HRC20 token built on the Harmony Network. At the time of writing, ONEMOON holders can store their ONEMOON tokens in Metamask, as well as buy and sell ONEMOON using the MochiSwap DEX on the Harmony Network. When ONEMOON holders buy, sell, send, or receive ONEMOON tokens a 10% transaction fee will be subtracted from the transaction total. For example: when User-A sends 1,000,000 ONEMOON tokens to User-B, a 10% fee will be provided by User-/\s transaction and used to power the ONEMOON tokenomics (for more on Tokenomics see: 'What are ONEMOON's Tokenomics?'). After the transaction fee, User B will then receive 900,000 ONEMOON tokens This transaction fee will be applied any time ONEMOON holders buy, sell, or send their ONEMOON tokens.
