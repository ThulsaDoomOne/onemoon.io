# Mars Colony Upgrade Analysis

### Summary

Below are the costs/benefits of fully upgrading one piece of land, followed by time analysis of upgrading based on 10 plots, as time taken to upgrade depends on how much $CLNY tokens are generated per day, per plot \* number of plots owned.

Based on the number of Mars plots owned (10), the time taken to upgrade the plots is shown below, with two options: 100% $CLNY allocated for upgrades, or 50% $CLNY allocated for upgrades, until level 1 is reached for all components. The $CLNY earnings are compounded after each plot upgraded.

After level 1 upgrade, benefit of upgrading drops by 50%, while costs increase. Revisit re-investment allocations at that time. See detailed analysis below.
