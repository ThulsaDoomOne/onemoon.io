# Mars Colony Upgrade Analysis

### Overview

The ONEMOON DAO owns 10 plots of land on Mars. Each plot of land generates revenue every day in the form of CLNY tokens which are owned by the DAO and will be used to fund DAO operations such as marketing, ONEMOON token buybacks/burns, etc. increasing awareness, adoption, and the value of the ONEMOON token. The CLNY revenue these plots generate can be increased by using a portion of the tokens earned to purchase upgrades, which increases the amount of CLNY tokens generated per day, as well as the value of the land plot itself. This analysis attempts to analyze the benefits of upgrading those plots, vs the time it would take, and the costs associated with doing so.

### Summary

Below are the costs/benefits of fully upgrading one piece of land, followed by time analysis of upgrading based on 10 plots, as time taken to upgrade depends on how much CLNY tokens are generated per day, per plot \* number of plots owned.

Based on the number of Mars plots owned (10), the time taken to upgrade the plots is shown below, with two options: 100% CLNY allocated for upgrades, or 50% CLNY allocated for upgrades, until level 1 is reached for all components. The CLNY earnings are compounded after each plot upgraded.

After level 1 upgrade, benefit of upgrading drops by 50%, while costs increase. Revisit re-investment allocations at that time. See detailed analysis below.
