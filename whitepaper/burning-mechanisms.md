# Burning Mechanisms

When tokens are burned through transaction fees, They are automatically sent to a burn wallet that no one can ever access because it was created without private keys, making the tokens forever inaccessible and permanently removed from supply

2% of every OneMoon transaction (buys, sells and transfers) are burned, thus reducing the supply of OneMoon tokens and increasing their value.

For transparency, anyone can research the amount of tokens that have been burned to date by opening the following URL: \
