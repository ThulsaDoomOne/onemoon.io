# Burning Mechanisms

Basic description:  Every so often, we burn ONEMOON.  What that means is that we send X amount of ONEMOON to a dead wallet.  That means we permanently decrease the supply of ONEMOON.  When the supply is decreased, the token value rises because they are permanently removed from the supply.\
