# Burning Mechanisms

ONEMOON incorporates a powerful DUAL burn system which also connects it to its parent ecosystem Mochiswap and the governance token therein $hMOCHI. This is a unique multicoin system that benefits the greater ecosystem which in turn benefits ONEMOON both economically and fundamentally as it is part of a larger system. When the configured threshold is reached, the burn process is initiated and will result in the following effects.

* 1.25% of tx fee value of ONEMOON is burned, lowering the max supply and increasing scarcity.
* 1.25% of tx fee value of hMOCHI is burned, lowering the max supply and increasing scarcity of the governance token in the supporting ecosystem of ONEMOON. This results in a very unique type of positive feedback loop that supports the economics of both tokens.
