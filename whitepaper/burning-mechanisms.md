# Burning Mechanisms

ONEMOON incorporates a powerful DUAL burn system which also connects it to its parent ecosystem Mochiswap and the governance token therein $hMOCHI. This is a unique multicoin system that benefits the greater ecosystem which in turn benefits ONEMOON both economically and fundamentally as it is part of a larger system. When the configured threshold is reached, the burn process is initiated and will result in the following effects.

2% is used to permanently burn ONEMOON, thus lowering the max supply and increasing scarcity.

1. I think we can keep the Burning Mechanisms page and just do a really basic description of what burning is and how much we're burning. Potentially put in information on the date the vote passed for the increased burn (removal of hmochi burn) Also maybe link the burn wallet for easy reference. Thoughts guys?





1. Yeah maybe just explain that they’re burned by sending them to the burn wallet that no one can ever access because it was created without private keys, making the tokens forever inaccessible and permanently removed from supply
2. _\[_4:30 AM_]_And yes provide the address to folks can see the amount of burned tokens to verify they’re there
